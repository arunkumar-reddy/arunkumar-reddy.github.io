I'm always open to and interested in learning new technologies because learning is fun. Outside of Tech, I am very passionate about Football and Tennis. I have been an Arsenal Fan for more than 10 years and one of my dreams is to visit the Emirates Stadium.

I am well versed with Android Architecture Components and the various libraries in the ecosystem. Kotlin Coroutines is fantastic for async programming and have been wanting to try out Jetpack Compose for declarative UI on Android. React Native is a fantastic framework for building cross platform applications for pure UI and with the introduction of Hermes has become even more light weight and faster.

Declarative UI with reusable components made popular by react is definitely the way forward. Progressive Web Applications are the future of the web as the web evolves to stay close to their mobile counterparts. I am well versed with the Browser and Javascript fundamentals as well as libraries like Redux for state management at scale.

You can find more details around these in my projects page. There was a lot of learning from these in terms of the potential of these techniques but also their limitations. I decided to move on as i had to focus more on robotics as part of my masters studies and later on began working at Flipkart. I still try to keep up to date by watching out for advances and solutions to existing limitations such as Transformers, One Shot Learning, Meta Learning etc.")))))}}},[[230,1,0]]]);
